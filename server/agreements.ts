/**
 * Native in-app e-signature (owner direction 2026-08-15; backlog dd37c973).
 *
 * Replaces the manual agreement-status tracker (PR #53) with a REAL internal
 * signer — no third-party service, no API keys, $0 per envelope. Flow:
 *
 *   1. Owner clicks "Send Agreements" on an Onboarding row → the server renders
 *      the owner's agreement template with the client's details, generates a
 *      PDF (pdf-lib, pure JS) stored in <data dir>/agreements/, mints an
 *      unguessable sign token (only its SHA-256 hash is stored), and emails
 *      the client a unique /sign/<token> link (existing Resend infra).
 *      Client agreement_status: not_sent → sent.
 *   2. Client opens the link → the public page records delivery (sent →
 *      delivered, first open only) and shows the agreement with Sign/Decline.
 *   3. Signing captures the typed name + explicit consent checkbox and records
 *      name, timestamp, IP address and consent (delivered → signed | declined).
 *      The link is one-time use: signed/declined pages render a final state.
 *
 * Owner-only everywhere: the send/list/audit APIs 403 for tenants, and tenant
 * settings responses never carry the template. The sign PAGE and POST are
 * deliberately public (the emailed link is the credential).
