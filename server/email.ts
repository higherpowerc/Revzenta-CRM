/**
 * 3g-4 — shared email module (client intake + welcome emails).
 *
 * Sends via Resend's built-in test sender (`onboarding@resend.dev`) — no
 * domain purchase needed; a real domain comes at Phase 5. The app must NEVER
 * crash or fail a request because email is not configured: when
 * RESEND_API_KEY is unset, `sendEmail` logs a skip line and returns a
 * non-ok result (never throws), so callers can fire-and-forget it from the
 * provisioning/login paths without touching the request that triggered it.
 *
 * Live-test finding #1 (2026-08-15): Resend's test mode returns HTTP 422 for
 * recipients that aren't the account owner's email, and the app still showed
 * "sent" because the old fire-and-forget `sendEmail` swallowed errors. The
 * return value now carries the outcome (`{ ok: true }` vs `{ ok: false,
 * error }`) so the two user-visible flows the owner hit (account
 * provisioning + agreement send) can surface a real "email failed" state.
 *
 * Reference for the exact Resend call shape (Bearer auth, `from` shape,
 * graceful key-missing handling): /home/team/shared/site/src/lib/contact.ts
